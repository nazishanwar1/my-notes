 (To merge branches locally, use git checkout to switch to the branch you want to merge into. This branch is typically
 the main branch. Next, use git merge and specify the name of the other branch to bring into this branch then push into github)
> git pull                                              (pull changes github to terminal)
 (go to github click on + sign, create new-file and commit then git pull,
used to fetch and download content from a remote repository(at github) and immediately update the local repository 
(at terminal) to match that content)
( if you create a file on main branch but you want to push that file to another branch then you need to merge that
 branch with main branch then you can push)
