============== Cloud Computing ===========
cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services over the internet on pay-as-you-go basis. Now you might think what does
that mean, let me explain, instead of managing files on a local storage we can save them over intenet through cloud computing and access 
them from the internet. As a mobile person i can access the storage from the internet anywhere because it's in the internet. it provides 
flexible resources, faster innovation and best of all we just need to pay for what we use.

------- types of cloud --------


we can catogories it on two wide categories on being a deployment model and the other being service model;
before to understand this concept let's go through an example, it'll be easy to understand;

consider the different types of vehicles to commute from one place to another. for example if i wanna travel i can pick a bus which is 
accessible to anyone I get in and I pay for the seat that I occupy and I pay for the time that I will be travelling in it and I'm done 
cost is very less here are similar kind of thing happens in the public cloud I pay only for the source that I use and I pay for long I
use if I use less I pay less if I use more I pay more for that month. 

on the other hand private cloud is like buying your own car and using it for commuting purpose here I pay a huge amount up front and 
it is all owned only by me I don't pay to it in an orderly fashion but completely and all up front the cost here is very huge.
 
thirdly if I want the best of both types like the comfort  on car and still don't want to pay all front otherwise only to pay for the 
time that I use the service I can rent a car similarly I can have it in a hybrid environment meaning if I already have dc's I can 
integrated with the cloud and use both the dc's and that would become and hybrid environment.


IAAS provides basic computing infra. based on pay-for-what you use model.providers are amazon web services,microsoft azure and google 
compute engine. user, IT administrators

PAAS provider gives you cloud platforms and runtime environments for developing, testing, and managing applicatioins. it allows 
software developers to deploy applications without requiring all the related infrastructure. users, software devlopers.


SAAS everything is amnaged by vendor and we just pay for the srvice, we don't have to maintain anything. users, end customers like us
example emails send through Gmail, we do not have any concern to the code or system behind this process.


regionis a physical location in the world and Regions are independent of each other and they are geographical distance from each other 
as well. within a region we then have availability zones, availability zones are composed of one or more data centers and you can 
essentially think of these as a cluster of data centers now there are lots of regions around the world. 

AWS regions are connected via a high bandwidth fully redundant network that's the WS global network backbone now each region will 
contain two or more availability zones so that means that you can deploy your resources across availability zones and you get lots of
redundancy by doing that there's also something called a local zone. local zones extend regions closer to end users reeally that's for 
reducing latency. latency is the delay over a network typically the farther you are from a a specific service the more latency there's 
going to be across that network.

The other regional part of AWS global infrastructure is regional edge caches and edge locations these are part of the cloud front 
network. cloud front network is a content delivery network services CDN and essentially what we use this for are to get content closer 
to our end users for better performance so for example we might cache video files or images in the edge locations that are close to our 
users around the world and there are many ede locations and regional edge caches so that means the latency is lower and the users can
download or watch those videos without having to go a long distance around the world to get them. so that's the cloudfront network and 
of course again these numbers are subject to change.


============== EC2 ============

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. 
Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many 
or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can add capacity (scale up) to handle
compute-heavy tasks, such as monthly or yearly processes, or spikes in website traffic. When usage decreases, you can reduce capacity 
(scale down) again.


Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
Preconfigured templates for the instances that package the components need for server (including the operating system and 
additional software).



============= EBS ==============

EC2 instance storage volumes which are suitable for holding temporary data EBS volumes are highly 
suitable for essentialsand long term data. EBS volumes are specific to availability zones and can
only be attached to instances within the same availability zone.
EBS volumes are independent of the EC2 instance they are attached to. The data in an EBS volume 
will remain unchanged even if the instance is rebooted or terminated.
Single EBS volume can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time. However, one EC2 can have 
more than one EBS volumes attached to it.
EBS volumes are specific to availability zones and can only be attached to EC2 in the same 
availability zone. In case AWS’ availability zone is to go down, access to the EBS volume 
will be lost.



====== Tyepes ======
1.	SSD: This storage type is suitable for small chunks of data that requires fast I/Ops. 
   SSDs can be used as root volumes for EC2 instances.
2.	HDD: This storage type is suitable for Big Data chunks and slower processing. These volumes
 cannot be used as root volumes for EC2. AWS claims that “These volumes provide expected throughput
 99.9% times of the year”





Hard Disks for EC2 servers: EBS volumes can be used as hard drives to your EC2 servers. They are 
independent of your EC2 servers and hence your data in these volumes is safe even if EC2 servers 
fails/reboots/terminate.
Hosting Large Applications: EBS provides an exceptionally low latency period amounting to a great 
computing power of the architecture. It can be used to hold big enterprise application software and 
data.
Root Volumes for EC2: EBS types GP2 and IO1 can be used as the root volumes for your EC2 server.


Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service that offers essential compute,
storage, and networking resources on demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis



Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources 
that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications.



Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. Common examples are email,
calendaring, and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365).
