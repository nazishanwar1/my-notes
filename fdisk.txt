====== fdisk ======
it is an early version of LVM to make disk partitions 


first of all add a disk 
> fdisk -l (to list all disks and partitions)
> fdisk /dev/sdb  (sdb is disk name ane this step use to format disk)
> m (for help)
> l (list)
> 8e (linux LVM)
> n (new partition)
> p (primary)
 (a drive has 4 partitions 1 for primary 3 for extended)
> w (to read table and exit)
> mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1 (make file system for 1st partition)
> mkdir /first-mount
> vim /etc/fstab (to enter disk partition in fstab)
> mount /first-mount
> mount -t auto /first-mount 
 (if do not mount)
